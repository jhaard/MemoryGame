## Memory Game Portfolio App.

### `A MemoryGame`  with the purpose to display use of the following:

* #### Kotlin Multiplatform with shared UI in Jetpack Compose
* #### MVVM architecture in an intermediate project.
* #### Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Swift/SwiftUI where it will be needed. 
* #### REST-API with Authorization. 
* #### Git structure and reflections of the work without the use of AI-generated code.
* #### Documentation in Code / README.
* #### Game logic, design and responsive UI.
* #### Unit testing when time is given.


### Progress of the game
<details>
<summary>Branches and Progress</summary><br>

Basic workflow: Feature-branches will be merged into a develop-branch when finished. Main branch
will be updated at certain stable points.

:white_check_mark: `feature/tile-component` is focused on creating a component for the tile and at click, the tile
should change it's state and show the content. It will also involve an animation when changing state.

:white_check_mark: `feature/ui-bord` will be a simple board implementing a list of tile components.
Also, since I will be using MVVM, an early structure must be formed.

:construction: `feature/icons-from-api` will implement icons to a collection to be used as content
for the tiles.
